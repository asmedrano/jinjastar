## Why?
I started working on my own personal website and thought I'd go the static file route. There are other more feature rich static file doodads out there but I rolled my own.

## What is it?
A wrapper around Jinja2 that'll lets you render jinja templates to Static html files

## Sample Usage
``` jstar.py -d ~/path/to/my_files -o /path/for/output ```

##TODO
* Add ability to include data as json and other formats and render in templates.
* Compressor/Minify ?
